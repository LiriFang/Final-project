Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall remain public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

# Title: 
Simulation of Parking around iSchool

## Team Member(s):
Liri Fang, Jiawei Li, Jing Du

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

In this project, we will designe a program to simulate the daily parking senario of iSchool students. Since the parking place on campus has limited number, especially near the School of Information Science Building. Sometimes it is hard for students to find a available place to park near the school. This project tries to using Monte Carlo simulation method to make a prediction about the probability of whether a ischool student successfully find a parking place at a particular time. Referencing this probability, the student can decide wether drive car to the school or park the car at somewhere else rather than near the school building.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:



### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
