Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall remain public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

# Title: 
Simulation of Parking around iSchool

## Team Member(s):

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

In this project, we will designe a program to simulate the daily parking senario of iSchool students. Since the parking place on campus has limited number, especially near the School of Information Science Building. Sometimes it is hard for students to find a available place to park near the school. This project tries to using Monte Carlo simulation method to make a prediction about the probability of whether a ischool student successfully find a parking place at a particular time. Referencing this probability, the student can decide wether drive car to the school or park the car at somewhere else rather than near the school building.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

This project only consider the meters near to the iSchool including the places on the streets and in the parking lots. 
The numebr of meters near the School of Information Science Building is: xxx, they are seperated on the xxxxx
To simplify the simulation model, we assume that meters nearing iSchool are all used by iSchool students. We suppose that most students drive to school for classes. Therefore, we assume the number of cars come to parking has a positive correlation with the class time. 
Additionaly, we idealize the time that driver consumes on the finding parking place and pull over. In the simulation system, all time spend on driving will be treated as 0.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty

*Need to be discussed later*

In this simulation, we have two variables of uncertainty:

* Number of cars already parked
<br>We use the time schedules of each class and its capacity to estimate the current number of students in the building. Using this estimated data we can multiply a range of percentage to find out the number of cars are parked.
The range of percentage is the probability of a student has a car and he/she will drive the car to the school. This data will be generated by statistic.

* Duration of parking period of each car
<br>**I have no idea.....**



## Instructions on how to use the program:

User only needs to run the program and enter the time he/she will arrive at school. The system will generate a probability of he/she can successfully find a parking place near the school building.
